# PetStoreManager
Welcome to my pet store manager project in Phoenix!  It is a Phoenix-based web application that displays a table with pet store data when run on a server. The table has columns for pet name, species, breed, owner last name, and age.To populate the table with data, I used the Faker library to generate 100 random pet entries, with 50 dogs and 50 cats. The look and feel of the web page has been customized using HTML and CSS. Additionally, I have implemented Elixir as the programming language for this project.
# To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
You can also add new data by visiting localhost:4000/new. The new data will be automatically added to your database. To access the data, you can give SQL queries.

# Table 
The table displays the following columns: name, species, breed, Owner LastName, and Age. To populate the table with data, I used the Faker library which created a total of 100 rows, with 50 dogs and 50 cats.
